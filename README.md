# CHAT APP #

This application is a learning process for myself. I'm developing it in order to learn application development with Node.js, Express.js and other various technologies.

### The Idea ###

[Socket.io](http://socket.io/) has a really well put together tutorial in which you build a very bare-bones chat application, just to get a sense of how Socket.io works, and let me tell you, it works wonders. A friend of mine have had a browser based game in mind for quite some time, and Socket.io seemed like it was built for our purposes. Therefore, the main purpose of this app is to get a better idea of how Socket.io works, and how to incorporate it into larger projects.
